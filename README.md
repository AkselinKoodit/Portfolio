# My portfolio project

## This is portfolio base I've made for myself as a school project while studying at Helsinki Business College on HTML & CSS course.

In the project I get familiar with different html and css styling tools. I also use little vanilla js to make the site more easy to use.

- Fonts from Google Fonts
