    <h2 id="background">Past</h2>
    <p>I was born in city of Kuopio, where I moved to Jyv채skyl채 to study. I graduated with Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management in 2012 from Jyv채skyl채 University of Applied Sciences. After that I have worked in tourism abroad and in Helsinki.<br> Long before all the troubles in the tourism industry, I had decided I wanted  to do something else with my life professionally and I was drawn to programming.
